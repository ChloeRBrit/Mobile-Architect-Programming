The app I created goal is to be an inventory tracking system. This includes adding and removing items from the grid inventory screen, a logging in system and a SMS system. I used colors
to make the user understand more about adding and removing. I used iterative development so every time I added a new system like login in I fully tested it then comtinued to add more systems which turned into the have I have.
I tested it from the user side, as a whole and indivuidualy if able. I explained what the app was deisgned for at first, for people to able to track inventory. As I was coding, the adding system was a bit difficult but reading
more about SQLite I was able to create a system that saves data from logins and the inventory.
